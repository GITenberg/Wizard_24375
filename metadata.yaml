description: Although the Masquerade itself, as a necessary protection against non-telepaths,
  was not fully formulated until the late years of the Seventeenth Century, groups
  of telepaths-in-hiding existed long before that date. Whether such groups were the
  results of natural mutations, or whether they came into being due to some other
  cause, has not yet been fully determined, but that a group did exist in the district
  of Offenburg, in what is now Prussia, we are quite sure. The activities of the group
  appear to have begun, approximately, in the year 1594, but it was not until eleven
  years afte.
